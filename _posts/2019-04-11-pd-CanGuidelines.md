Parkinson’s disease is complex and each person’s experience is unique, from age of onset to diagnosis and management of symptoms. The Canadian Guidelines on Parkinson’s Disease will provide health care professionals with a detailed understanding of Parkinson’s.

The Guidelines are intended for a broad range of health professionals including: family physicians, neurologists, nurses, movement disorders specialists, allied health professionals (e.g. occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech language pathologists) and other specialists. The Clinical Guidelines, published for the first time in 2012, will increase knowledge and will guide the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson’s.
